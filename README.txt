/*This is IROIRO, a website that introduces Japanese culture through a spectrum of colors. Through this website, I want readers
to understand how colorful and rich of a culture Japan is.*/

Browsing instruction
--------------------
1. Please start from intro.html inside the root dir

2. When browsing around each color pages, please scroll *slowly and easily* for the best experience.
Scrolling effect is still buggy if scroll up and down too fast (because timing by js is difficult,
in next implementation I will improve on scrolling effect more).

3. The website works best on most common landscape full-width resolution (FHD, HiDPI, MDPI, Ipad
Pro landscape, Ipad landscape),  Ipad portrait, and phones from from iPhone X and up.

- Please test the website responsiveness with landscape PC first. Ipad portrait screen size (768px) is
also okay. 
But from 1024 to 1366px, it is very rare that screen be sized this way, so I swift my focus on
more common and practical sizes first.
